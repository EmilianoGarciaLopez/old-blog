I don't currently have a use for a blog, but I think I will pretty soon. I'll be doing the DA Independent study next year and that requires a blog. I also suspect that my Literature class will also require me to have one. I don't know how easy it will be to express my ideas in such a public manner, but It'll definitely be an intersting experience.
